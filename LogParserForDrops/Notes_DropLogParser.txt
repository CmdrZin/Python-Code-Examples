1. First effort is to break out seperate out "You have looted .." entries into a new file "Loot_+<filename>".

Steps - dropLogParse.py
Open filename given by input. Read Only text.
Open "DL_+<filename>" file as Write text.
Read in file, line by line.
Scan line to find first "You have looted a", then string up to "from". This is what was looted. After the "from" 
is what dropped the loot. Can stop at the " 's " string.
NOTE: Could be a number after "looted ". If so, there's no "a". Could also be an "an". So the number replaces "a" or "an"
between the two spaces after "from".
Add "I'll give you " tag and record these lines also.
Based on scan, write line to file.

 2. Don't worry about quantity now. Skip past the next space after 'from ' and treat all until ' or . as an item.
Make a dictionary for db[name].  'source', 'sellTo', 'buyFrom'
PROBLEM: Loot can have multiple sources. A Source can drop multiple loot. Make sourece a list, use append() to add. Fixed..ok..
Fixed . or ' ending charactor in source description.
TODO: Check if key exists, check for item on source list. Add if not there. Stops overwrite. DONE..works great.
Add CSV output to test spreadsheet importing. Almost. Doesn't group multiple sources into one cell..hmm...hah. fixed..works..

3. Figure out sell and buy prices and get mob level.

4. Drop rate
